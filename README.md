<h1>Project Title</h1>
Netflix Content Strategy Dashboard
<h1>1. Project Overview</h1>
Netflix has a massive library of over 8,000 titles. However, looking at a plain list of movies makes it hard to see trends. The goal of this project was to analyze the data visually to answer some key business questions: Is Netflix focusing more on Movies or TV Shows? Which countries produce the most content? How has the amount of content added changed over time? Who is the target audience (Kids vs. Adults)?
<h1>2. Tools Used Power BI</h1>
For building the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, like "Not Given" directors, and standardized rating categories directly in Power BI
<h1>What I Did</h1>
Data Connection: Loaded the netflix1.csv dataset containing titles, directors, countries, and release years.
Data Modeling: Organized the data to allow filtering by Year and Genre. 
Visualization: Created a Decomposition Tree to allow users to drill down into specific categories, such as finding the top Genres in India. Built a Time Series Analysis to show the increase in content added between 2016 and 2021. Designed a Geographic Analysis to highlight the top producing countries, including the USA, India, and the UK.
<h1>4. Key Insights Found </h1>
ontent Split: The library is dominated by Movies, making up about 70%, compared to TV Shows, which account for about 30%. 
Top Producers: The United States is the largest contributor, followed by India and the UK. 
Growth Trend: Content addition peaked significantly around 2019 before stabilizing.
Audience: The majority of content is rated for Mature Audiences (TV-MA), indicating a shift toward adult-focused entertainment
<h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
This dashboard turns raw data into an interactive story. It allows stakeholders to easily explore the Netflix catalog and make informed decisions about future content strategy.
