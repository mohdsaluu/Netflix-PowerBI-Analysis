<h1>Project Title</h1>
Netflix Content Strategy Dashboard
<h1>1. Project Overview</h1>
Netflix has a massive library of over 8,000 titles. However, looking at a plain list of movies makes it hard to see trends. 
<br></br>
The goal of this project was to analyze the data visually to answer some key business questions:
<br></br>
Is Netflix focusing more on Movies or TV Shows? 
<br></br>
Which countries produce the most content? 
<br></br>
How has the amount of content added changed over time? Who is the target audience (Kids vs. Adults)?
<br></br>
<h1>2. Tools Used Power BI</h1>
<br></br>
For building the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
<br></br>
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, like "Not Given" directors, and standardized rating categories directly in Power BI
<br></br>
<h1>3. What I Did</h1>
<br></br>
Data Connection: Loaded the netflix1.csv dataset containing titles, directors, countries, and release years.
<br></br>
Data Modeling: Organized the data to allow filtering by Year and Genre. 
<br></br>
Visualization: Created a Decomposition Tree to allow users to drill down into specific categories, such as finding the top Genres in India.
<br></br>
Built a Time Series Analysis to show the increase in content added between 2016 and 2021. 
<br></br>Designed a Geographic Analysis to highlight the top producing countries, including the USA, India, and the UK.
<br></br>
<h1>4. Key Insights Found </h1>
<br></br>
Content Split: The library is dominated by Movies, making up about 70%, compared to TV Shows, which account for about 30%. 
<br></br>
Top Producers: The United States is the largest contributor, followed by India and the UK. 
<br></br>
Growth Trend: Content addition peaked significantly around 2019 before stabilizing.
<br></br>
Audience: The majority of content is rated for Mature Audiences (TV-MA), indicating a shift toward adult-focused entertainment
<br></br>
<h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
<br></br>
This dashboard turns raw data into an interactive story. 
<br></br>
It allows stakeholders to easily explore the Netflix catalog and make informed decisions about future content strategy.
