<h1>Project Title</h1>
Netflix Content Strategy Dashboard
<h1>1. Project Overview</h1>
Netflix has a massive library of over 8,000 titles. However, looking at a plain list of movies makes it hard to see trends. The goal of this project was to analyze the data visually to answer some key business questions: Is Netflix focusing more on Movies or TV Shows? Which countries produce the most content? How has the amount of content added changed over time? Who is the target audience (Kids vs. Adults)?
